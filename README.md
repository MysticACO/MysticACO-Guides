Welcome to Mystic ACO. This is a in-depth guide on how the server works.

## Overview
- At Mystic ACO, our goal is simple: to help you secure the most limited and hyped items—stress-free.
  
- When you sign up for our Auto-Checkout (ACO) service, you’re letting us handle the heavy lifting on drop day. Just sit back and relax—we only charge you if we successfully secure the item for you. No success, no fee.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Visit the Auto Checkout Section
Head over to our ACO section where you’ll find forms for all upcoming releases.
Choose Your Drop
Find the form for the release you’re interested in and click the link—it’ll take you to a Google Form. Fill in your info carefully and double-check everything before submitting. Once submitted, no edits or cancellations are allowed.

We Take It From There
On drop day, we’ll run your details through our bots to secure your item.

Success = Payment
If your slot hits, you'll receive a confirmation email and have 48 hours to complete your Pay After Success (PAS) payment.
