# FAQs

**What is PAS Fee?**

- The PAS Fee (Pay After Success) is our service fee, charged only when we successfully secure the item for you. You pay nothing upfront — the fee is due only after your item has been purchased.

**What payment methods do you accept?** 

- Zelle, Cashapp, Paypal, and Venmo

**If my order is cancelled, will I be refunded?** 

- Yes. If your order is cancelled, simply open a ticket within our server provide your cancellation email and order number. We’ll issue a refund for the service fee right away.

**Can I submit ACO multiple times?**

- Yes. Each entry must contain unique personal information — including name, address, payment details, email, and phone number — so that every profile appears to belong to a different individual.

**Is ACO guaranteed?** 

- Simple answer is no. While we do our best to maximize your chances, many factors can affect success — including low stock, site changes, bot errors, or incorrect information provided. The good news is that you only pay if we succeed, so there’s no financial risk to you.

**Did I submit my entry correctly?**

- We handle a high volume of members, so we can’t manually verify every entry before importing. Please make sure your form is filled out correctly. If something’s off with your submission, we’ll contact you to get it fixed.
