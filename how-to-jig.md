## What Is Jigging?

Jigging is one of the most important techniques when aiming to secure multiple orders. It involves slightly modifying your billing or shipping details so they appear unique to retailers, while still ensuring your packages arrive at the correct destination. Below is an extensive guide on how to jig your profiles.

## Common Jigging Methods

Retailers often enforce strict quantity limits and will cancel duplicate orders tied to the same address or account. By applying effective jigging methods, you can increase your chances of bypassing these restrictions, securing multiple items, and reducing the risk of order cancellations. 

**1. Address Line 2 Jig**

If your shipping address is not tied to an actual apartment or unit, you can **"fake"** one by adding a unit number at the end of your address or in **Address Line 2.**

> **Before:**  1234 Mystic Drive

> **After:** 1234 Mystic Drive, Apt 1

**2. Abbreviation Jig**

Some retailers don’t properly recognize variations in street abbreviations, making this a simple but effective jig.

> **Before:** 1234 Mystic Drive

> **After:** 1234 Mystic Dr

**3. Random Letter Jig**

A popular option for apartments and houses alike is to add three random letters before your address.

> **Before:**  1234 Mystic Street

> **After:** ABCD 1234 Mystic Street

    <b>💡</b> The effectiveness of each jig depends on the retailer’s anti-bot protections. Becoming familiar with multiple methods ensures you’re prepared no matter the site.

## Profile Variations

Jigging your address is important, but optimizing the rest of your profile is equally critical. Strong, varied profiles—covering names, emails, phone numbers, and payment methods—help reduce detection, lower the risk of cancellations or declines, and increase overall checkout success.

- **Name:** Use a different realistic first and last name for each profile. Random name generators can help create believable variations.

- **Payment Methods:** Rotate payment methods across profiles. Many users employ virtual credit cards (VCCs) and a mix of physical cards to avoid declines.

> **VCC's Example: (AMEX, Capital One ENO, Privacy, Slash, Extend)**

- **Email:** Choose one consistent email strategy and apply it across profiles so you can manage confirmations easily.

    - **Catchalls:** A catchall routes all emails for a domain into a single inbox. [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) and [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) offers affordable options for this.

    - **Gmail “Dot” Trick:** Gmail ignores dots in the local part of addresses, allowing many permutations to deliver to the same inbox **(e.g., Mys.tic@gmail.com)**

- **Phone Numbers:** Use unique phone numbers per profile. If using generated numbers, make sure the area code aligns with your actual location for consistency.
