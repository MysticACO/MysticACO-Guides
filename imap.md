# IMAP Tutorial

IMAP lets us read verification emails directly from your mail provider.  
This is required for sites that need verification codes or password resets.

<div class="alert danger">

## ⚠ REQUIRED FOR CHECKOUT
If IMAP is not configured correctly, we will NOT receive your verification codes.

This can cause failed checkouts and missed items.  
Mystic ACO is not responsible for missed purchases due to incorrect email setup.

## What IMAP Allows Us To Do
- Automatically read verification codes (Nike, SNKRS, Shopify, Target, Walmart)
- Confirm account logins
- Handle password resets

### What We CANNOT See
- We cannot send emails
- We cannot access personal messages
- We only access retailer verification emails

</div>

<div class="alert warning">

## 🚫 Do NOT Do This During a Run
<ul class="donot">
<li>Do NOT open verification emails yourself</li>
<li>Do NOT mark retailer emails as spam</li>
<li>Do NOT change the password</li>
<li>Do NOT log into the account</li>
<li>Do NOT remove the payment method</li>
</ul>

Opening the email first invalidates the verification code and causes checkout failure.
