## User Agreement

- Mystic ACO reserves the right to modify or update these terms at any time. Continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.

- Mystic ACO is not responsible for any unauthorized charges or failed checkouts. All information provided is deleted after the release is complete or once the product is secured.

- Submitting false, incomplete, or repetitive information will result in refusal of service and may lead to a permanent ban.

## Pay After Success (PAS)

- Mystic ACO operates under a Pay-After-Success model. You will only be charged the PAS Fee if we successfully purchase the requested item on your behalf.

- If your checkout is successful, you will be contacted within 24 hours to arrange payment of the PAS Fee. Payment must be completed within 72 hours of confirmation.

- Failure to pay within the 72-hour window will result in a cancellation of your order and permanent ban from all future ACO services.

- If a retailer cancels your order, you must provide proof of cancellation (e.g., the cancellation email) to receive a refund of your PAS Fee.

- If you personally contact the retailer to cancel your order, no refund will be issued.

- Once an order has shipped, the PAS Fee is non-refundable. Any further issues must be resolved directly with the retailer.
